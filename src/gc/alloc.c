 * This is a garbage collecting storage allocator
 * that should run on most UNIX systems.  The garbage
 * collector is overly conservative in that it may fail to GC_reclaim
 * inaccessible storage.  On the other hand, it does not assume
 * any runtime tag information.
 * We make the following assumptions:
 *  1.  We are running under something that looks like Berkeley UNIX,
 *      on one of the supported architectures.
 *  2.  For every accessible object, a pointer to it is stored in
 *          a) the stack segment, or
 *          b) the data or bss segment, or
 *          c) the registers, or
 *          d) an accessible block.
 *
 */

/*
 * Separate free lists are maintained for different sized objects
 * up to MAXOBJSZ.
 * The call GC_allocobj(i,k) ensures that the freelist for
 * kind k objects of size i points to a non-empty
 * free list. It returns a pointer to the first entry on the free list.
 * In a single-threaded world, GC_allocobj may be called to allocate
 * an object of (small) size i as follows:
 *
 *            opp = &(GC_objfreelist[i]);
 *            if (*opp == 0) GC_allocobj(i, NORMAL);
 *            ptr = *opp;
 *            *opp = ptr->next;
 *
 * Note that this is very fast if the free list is non-empty; it should
 * only involve the execution of 4 or 5 simple instructions.
 * All composite objects on freelists are cleared, except for
 * their first word.
 */

/*
 *  The allocator uses GC_allochblk to allocate large chunks of objects.
 * These chunks all start on addresses which are multiples of
 * HBLKSZ.   Each allocated chunk has an associated header,
 * which can be located quickly based on the address of the chunk.
 * (See headers.c for details.) 
 * This makes it possible to check quickly whether an
 * arbitrary address corresponds to an object administered by the
 * allocator.
