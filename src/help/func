Russell functions can be explicitly constructed by an expression of the
form:

        function_signature { ;_separated_expression_sequence }

The result part of the function signature may be omitted if it is apparent
from the body.  If it is given, it must match (i.e. be the same as,
except for extra type components) as the signature of the last expression
in the function body.

An application of the resulting function will result in evaluation of
the expression sequence with parameters bound to argument values.
The value of the application will be that of the last expression.

See also: signatures, applications.
