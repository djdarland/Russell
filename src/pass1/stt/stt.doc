				 Russell String Table

The string table is conceptually an infinite array of bytes, which is broken up
into blocks, each of size STTBLKSZ. Strings are stored in string table
entries, a new entry starting on the first word boundry after the last one
in the table. Each entry can then be referenced as the index in this
array of the first byte of its entry (a so called relative pointer). Blocks
are numbered starting at 0, and a new block is allocated when the last
one fills up. Strings are uniquely numbered (with their relational pointers) 
in increasing order as they are entered, and these numbers can be used
to test for string equality and order of first encounter.

	For the purposes of entering and looking strings up quickly ,
a seperate array of hash headers is kept during scanning. Each header
points the start of a chain of entries which have the same hash.

	After scanning, the table is written out to the string table file.
